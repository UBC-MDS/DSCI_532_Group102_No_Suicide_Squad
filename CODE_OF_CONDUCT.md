# The No Suicide Squad Code of Conduct

Most of this Code of Conduct is from the [UBC Data Science 100 Code of Conduct](https://github.com/UBC-DSCI/dsci-100/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Introduction
In our DSCI 532 group project, we believe in creating a respectful environment for learning and collaboration. We value all group members, and as such, all members are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.

To ensure we are on the same page, all group members are required to abide by the Code of Conduct during all project meetings and during communication with the team and teaching staff. Team members are also expected to assist with enforcing the Code of Conduct. 

## Code of Conduct
In our DSCI 532 Project, we are committed to supporting a learning atmosphere that is accessible and welcoming to all, regardless of background, identity, or level of experience. We do not tolerate any type of disrespectful behavior, including but not limited to behavior that excludes, intimidates, or discriminates against others. We expect all group members to respect each othersâ€™ characteristics, including but not limited to:  gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience level.
<br/> <br/>
All group members are required to abide by and assist with enforcing this Code of Conduct during all communications (in-person, via telephone, or virtual) with the team and/or teaching staff.

## 2.1 Expected Behavior
All member interactions are expected to show respect and courtesy to each other. All interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person. In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following:
- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the group
- Show courtesy and respect towards other group members


## 2.2 Unacceptable Behavior
Examples of unacceptable behavior by team members include, but are not limited to: <br/>
- Written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group
- Causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation
- Violent threats or language directed against another person
- The display of sexual or violent images
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
- Sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
- Insults or put downs
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
- Incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
- Continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop publication of private communication without consent
<br/> <br/>

## 2.3 Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
When a group member notices behavior that goes against our code of conduct, they are expected to approach the group member in question in a respectful and non-confrontational manner. Members who are asked to stop inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately. This applies to all group meetings and communication. If the group member fails to change/remedy their behavior, the group members and/or DSCI 532 teaching team may investigate this Code of Conduct violation.
