# Team Reflection - Understanding Suicide Rates App

## What It Does Well 

- Our app answers our 2 major research questions in what we believe is an organized and easy-to-follow fashion. It also allows for interactivity, and the tooltips display individual numerical values.

- The visualizations are separated into 2 tabs by research question, which reduces cluttering and allows for better organization.

- There is a clear overall purpose and general instructions for the app listed at the top. There are also step-by-step instructions for each plot which guides the user through a narrative (e.g. “Now that you’ve had a chance to explore the suicide rate by continent and subregion, are there any countries you’d like to look into more?”.) 

- The ‘worldwide average’ dashed line in tab 1 allows the user to visually compare how their selected region/country/demographic group to the rest of the world. 

## Limitations

#### Tab 1
- Some of the drop-downs are very lengthy (e.g. the countries list), and requires the user to scroll to the country they are looking for. 

- The ‘hover’ feature has not been enabled on the ‘worldwide average’ line. 

- There is missing data for certain countries, years, and demographics, so if a user selects these locations/demographics, the charts may not look updated, which can cause confusion.

<br/> <br/>

#### Tab 2
- If the user does not open the graph in a full-screen window, the year range slider does not change in size, and as a result, appears squished. 

- There is no way to “select all” graphs; if the user wants to see all groups, they need to manually check each box.

## Future Improvements and Additions

#### Tab 1
- For the lengthy dropdowns, a potential solution would be to add a ‘search’ button at the top of dropdowns where they can start typing in the name of the country/feature they are interested in, and the dropdown will automatically shorten to match that name.

- We could remove the locations/demographics with missing data.

<br/> <br/>

#### Tab 2
- For the non-full-screen issues, we should find a way to resize the slider so it appears proportionally on a window of any size. 

- For the checkboxes, we could include a “select all” or “deselect all” option.

## Addressing TA Feedback

#### Issues
We were reminded to use GitHub Issues to communicate with our team. We were previously using Slack, but started creating Issues to allow us to locate our action items in a more centralized location. This also helps us keep track of what has been resolved and what still needs to be done. 

<br/> <br/>

#### Coding and Submitting Pull Requests
We were reminded to make sure that the work is being distributed equally. To resolve this, we each tackled certain issues and code chunks (e.g. two graphs each). Please note that sometimes we only worked off one computer due to dying laptops/internet connectivity issues. 

<br/> <br/>

#### General Milestone 1 Feedback
We ensured that the links on our repos linked to specific commits. We also added instructions/a “narrative” to our app to help the user navigate our app.
